# EPoL: An Efficient Consensus in Blockchain Using Machine Learning


Proof of Work (PoW) describes a consensus mechanism that requires a significant amount of computing effort from a network of devices, commonly known as mining. In a typical PoW system, miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles, where the goal is to find a specific nonce value using the SHA-256 algorithm. This process is computationally intensive and requires significant energy expenditure, as miners must repeatedly hash different nonce values until the correct one is found. However, the energy consumed in this process could be directed towards more meaningful computational tasks. Machine learning models can be trained to solve real-world problems, and their integration into blockchain could enhance the systemâ€™s overall utility. This approach can also mitigate the issue of resource wastage associated with traditional PoW mechanisms.

In this project, we have implemented machine learning algorithms to select miners in the Ethereum network. By considering accuracy as a key parameter, we ensure that miners are chosen based on their contribution to solving practical problems. This not only promotes fairer competition but also aligns the computational efforts of miners with meaningful tasks, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and utility of the blockchain system.
